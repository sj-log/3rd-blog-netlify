# 4. Why government targets young people for vote?

왜 정부는 젊은 층을 투표 타겟으로 잡는가?

First, because **current goverment stands for Young people** who wish to have more clean country. What does it mean 'Young people want to clean goverment'? as you can ruminate this Moon goverment nextly comes out against Previous goverment. Previous goverment had based on old generation. The previous goverment cooperated with overly-authorized enterprises which are called JaeBul.
**JaeBul** has been grasping the supralegal power by collaborating with politicians. Even they got some supports from juridiction side to avoid their inhibit.

Second, Their contrary party '자유한국당(Liberty Korea Party)' is based on the **old generation.** So to hold this goverment's power, they have to ask votes the young generation. Since the young generations vote rates had been lower than the old generation, the goverment represented only conservative people.

Third, Old generations had already acknowledged why they have to vote for this country. Ironically, The most reason why their high rate participation is based on their ideological mindset. Since the conservative media keep blurring the real issue but pushing that to the ideological perspective, old generation cannot just stand for its happening.
the old generation, 70-80s people when they were growing up, the goverment were overwrapping only anti-communism which is rewinding North Korea, which is Enermy.

So Whenever, the Democratic parties argue for justice and innovative steps, nomally that stopoped by Conservative parties, because Conservative parties always entrap them as a Communist, but nobody knows they were really spy or communist.

by above all reasons, most young Korean people felt exhausted from this disputatious match whenever something comes out from media, and that why this democratic parties ask for more empowering by Young generations voting.
