# You just need to download Touchpad Driver!

Somehow My blog's visitors are usually, the English Users,
So I should put here down by English.

I've suffered to be unable to use Touchpad.
But since, [Ellie](https://instagram.com/fullyraw.jennie_md) wants Macbook and pad, I **found the touchpad's usage can bring super convience on laptop working**

hence, I've figured out how to use the touchpad scroling as mouse whilee does.

Here is the way.

1. You need check whether Touchpad Driver installed or not.

for this procedure, [the website address](https://support.lenovo.com/id/ko/search?query=touchpad%20driver) I left.

You need to know below.

    1. Which model of laptop do you use?
    I use, `Lenovo Pascal 320-15`

    2. Which window do you use?
        1. for this, you need to type `window key` + `R`
        2. Search with `winver`
        `win 10 64 bit` I use

2. Download the file, install it, Restart your laptop once!
3. Finished!
